# Authentification-Authorization
The primary focus of this project is to implement a role-based access control system for various resources. 
### User Management

- **Register Page**:
    - The "Register" page creates a user and assigns them the default role "Buyer" and "Regular" type.

- **Login and Logout**:
    - The "Login" page is accessible via the "Login" tab in the main menu. When a user is logged in, the link changes to "Logout."
